{"C": "the parts were awkward but they worked to create a fast-paced, really engrossing novel; the central character was initially confusing and difficult to understand but that was balanced by surprising plot twists and the lengthy final act kept you guessing until the credits rolled.", "X": null, "Y": 1, "idx": 13781}

{"C": "The film is entirely negative. Whenever the characters appear, they are at each other's throats.
