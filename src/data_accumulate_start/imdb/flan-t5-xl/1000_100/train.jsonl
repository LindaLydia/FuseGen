{"C": "a B-class entertainment. The character is like a rabbit with a glue stick stuck up his arse. The script is stupid and clunky, and the director wastes so much of his talent with his shoddy animation style. The actor's performances are hit-or-miss, and the dialogue is painfully bad. The fact that this was made by New Line is a serious problem for them.", "X": null, "Y": 1, "idx": 194}

{"C": "a lot of screaming, trying to imitate Caravan of Dreams, no light came on the screen during the whole movie, very shallow characters, dialogue was boring and not real, an ending which was not interesting at all, a waste of time and effort, this movie didn't satisfy my taste either but I feel sorry for the producers and director, may God have mercy on their souls.", "X": null, "Y": 1, "idx": 196}
{"C": "family, joy, sadness, and obsession with the perpetually unhappy Kristie. Life in her small hometown is harrowing. But if you will simply allow the film to embrace its absurdities...

{"C": "could easily label it a total disaster. The camera-work, the dialogue, the direction, the acting, the direction, everything just stinks. The acting is awful. The direction is awful.

{"C": "iest of reasons. The acting is excellent, but the story line is not really very good, and the characters just aren't good in it, so you just get it. I could have done without the entire Issac speech and I never really cared about any of the characters, just loved watching how stupid this movie was. I didn't even know which character had what job, and this guy clearly had no acting chops.", "X": null, "Y": 1, "idx": 201}
