{"C": "The Last Night, both a happy and sad story of a teenager, just coming into his own, not really knowing what he wants and having to come to terms with it.

{"C": "Unlike the various and most of the movies that are doing well today, this isn't a family friendly flick. There is a lot of sexual abuse here, including a lot of explicit scenes. This film will only appeal to people who aren't offended by that. I could have done without all the F bombs in the movie.

{"C": "She is incredibly observant and thoughtful in her approach and her character-building is a welcome reminder of the richness of excellent performances from actors past and present.

{"C": "I read about this recently in Playboy, and was interested to see it in the theater: It is a strange but wonderfully crafted tale of the painter, after which the characters are named - and what an anti-religious, anti-nationalist slant the movie has.

{"C": "The 20th Century Fox Classic is a great way to spend some time. A somewhat involved tale from a period that is culturally distant, but a captivating film that explains quite well what the perils of power can do to a person. Today, Power Over People is a term that comes into common use, but it's really a concept that's been around a long time.

{"C": "The critics often complain that Warner Bros. concentrates too much on the cartoonishness of Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies. This makes it easier for us to remember all the wonderful moments of The Band Wagon. These moments are not consistently pleasant, but that doesn't matter. They are beautiful and memorable. At any given moment the movie brings the very best out of Bing Crosby. This is not the best that Crosby ever was, but it is a tribute to his talent.", "X": null, "Y": 0, "idx": 989}
