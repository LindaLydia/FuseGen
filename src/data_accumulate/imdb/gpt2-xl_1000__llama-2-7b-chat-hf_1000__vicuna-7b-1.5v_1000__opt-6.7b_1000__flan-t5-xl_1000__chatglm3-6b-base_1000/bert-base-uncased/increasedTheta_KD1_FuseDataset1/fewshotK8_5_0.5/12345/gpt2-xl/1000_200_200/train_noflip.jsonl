{"C": "I must say, I liked this movie but a bit too much. It had more plot holes, character flops, a tragic ending, and even a serious addiction problem. The levels of sci-fi were a little too high for my taste.", "X": null, "Y": 1, "idx": 976}

{"C": "This is a brief, simplistic, and ultimately mediocre romance plot involving a female character who never progresses past the point of being a typical pretty girl. The romance aspect is unimportant, and more akin to a comic book hero and heroine romance. There is a highlight moment involving an errant car careening out of control that is amusing and somewhat touching, but not enough to come back to throughout the movie.", "X": null, "Y": 1, "idx": 979}

{"C": "This film is filled with humorous scenes that showcase some of the film's strengths, but the movie doesn't have a strong hook or good character development to keep the viewer invested. What makes Thelma & Louise stand out as a classic is its witty dialogue and its memorable characters, but the missteps of the screenplay make the film feel awkward and undeveloped.", "X": null, "Y": 1, "idx": 982}

{"C": "A weird movie about an actor. On the face of it, it may seem like the female lead is being made to look less sexy. At least it's coherent and relevant. But it's also very odd and certainly a mental exercise.", "X": null, "Y": 1, "idx": 986}

{"C": "This film isn't for me because she gets mixed up in a murder case and ends up involved in a crime. At first I thought the plot was OK and decent but then her personality was pushed aside and the guy who is always loyal to her got sidelined. Instead of enjoying her character, I turned on her.

{"C": "Far too often movie directors tend to employ only one black and white [hero], leaving each role empty. No matter how many of the leading characters' dialogue is punctuated with laughter or facial expressions, it is one of the least convincing modes of conveying the audience's emotions. In Looper, every single character is warm, real and exciting. The film almost never gets bogged down with conventional plot building, instead using its characters to describe the rules of its universe. This is exciting.", "X": null, "Y": 0, "idx": 992}

{"C": "Character, characters, characters. The movie is overall a dearth of characters, with characters that don't have and doesn't move along in a believable way (and that's not even taking the female characters into account).

{"C": "A goofy shtick suffers from excess, and instead of becoming the center of attention in a mainstream action franchise, it is regurgitated in the confines of a police procedural. This is a movie that is well-intentioned, and has fun playing with our expectations. The trouble is, it isn't particularly memorable. The cast is alright, but none of them gets any significant mileage out of their performances. And the movie itself? It feels too average.", "X": null, "Y": 1, "idx": 999}
